                "In windsurfing you don’t have trainers, you don’t get support from your club and you don’t have anybody guiding your way. For years I’ve been struggling with structuring my day and training program on a professional level. Thanks to Fabian’s help I’m finally getting more efficient with the things I have to get done on a daily basis and I now know better what things to focus on."

              "Working with Fabian was a truly educational and enriching experience for our athletes and our coaching staff. His insight into the demands of a young university athlete helped not only them to address some of their struggles with a better understanding of themselves, but it also prepared us coaches to be better equipped in supporting our players."
